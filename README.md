C$50 Finance

Implement a website via which users can "buy" and "sell" stocks.

If you’re not quite sure what it means to buy and sell stocks (i.e., shares of a company), head to http://www.investopedia.com/university/stocks/ for a tutorial.

You’re about to implement C$50 Finance, a web app via which you can manage portfolios of stocks. Not only will this tool allow you to check real stocks' actual prices and portfolios' values, it will also let you buy (okay, "buy") and sell (okay, "sell") stocks by querying IEX for stocks' prices.

Indeed, IEX lets you download stock quotes via URLs like https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/NFLX/quote. Notice how Netflix’s symbol (NFLX) is embedded in this URL; that’s how IEX knows whose data to return.
